Hello, my name is Paul Fischer.
<br />
<br />
I am a full-stack [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com){.dark:text-blue-400} independent consultant.
<br />
<br />
I have spent most of my career doing enterprise level web applications.  [In my free time](https://github.com/paulmfischer){.dark:text-blue-400}, I tend to spend time building (and sometimes finishing?) personal web sites or game development projects. Most of my personal projects are to either learn something new (like [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor){.dark:text-blue-400}) or just to code in a different language or framework.
<br />
