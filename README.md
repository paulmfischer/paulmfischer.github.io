Hello! And welcome to my blog website codebase, have a look around and see the sights!

Things can change here and quickly sometimes, all just depends on what is going on in my life and if I feel like tinkering with another blogging engine to scratch some itch.

That itch currently is to use a static site generator to build out my blog post and host it with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).  I am currently doing that using [Lume](https://lume.land/) which also lets me utilize [Deno](https://deno.com/) to write components for my blog as well as write all my posts in Markdown.

#### Previous blog engines used
Before March 2024: 
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
  - I used [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) as a starting point to using Jekyll.
  - This worked well and I liked the theme/layout that Chirpy gave me so I tried to replicate it as much as possible with my current redesign.  The problem is that Jekyll uses Ruby and I am not really a Ruby developer so I didn't like digging around or changing things much.

#### If you would like to run my site locally

1. Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual)
2. Clone repo
3. Run `deno task serve` from root folder
4. Develop!
